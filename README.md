# Pocket Farm V

This is a continuation of ye olde SCiUS Forum IX project '**Pocket Farm : A Small-Scale Plant Factory**'

The goal is to simplify and improve stability of the machine, as well as improve source code so that it is easier to maintainance.

## Background

From SCiUS Forum IX abstract:

> **Pocket Farm : *A Small-Scale Plant Factory***
> Mr.Karn Jaroenporn
> Mr.Krit Patyarath

> Plant growing facility is considered by many to be future of farming but often constructed in large scale. Concerning the growing of urban agriculture, a device is built for one whom wants to grow small plants in small scale (e.g. growing lectures in backyard garden) with integrated automatic system. The device consists of irrigation system using drip irrigation technique, LED for artifactual sun light, ventilation fan for air flow, humidity controlling and simple temperature controlling using difference of inside and outside temperature. The device can be controlled using application Line. Controlling system was written in C++, Line communication and hardware controller were written in Python using a single-board computer Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ as a microcontroller.

## TODO

- **Reimplement core programs into one centralized program**
- Add comments
- Add error handling
